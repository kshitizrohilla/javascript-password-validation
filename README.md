# JavaScript Password Validation

This is a simple JavaScript code snippet that provides real-time password validation based on specific requirements. It checks whether a password meets the following criteria:

- At least 8 characters in length
- At least one lowercase letter (a...z)
- At least one uppercase letter (A...Z)
- At least one special character (!, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), -, _, +, =, {, }, [, ], :, ;, <, >, ., ,, ?, /, |, \, `, ~)
- At least one digit (0...9)

## Getting Started

To use the password validation code, follow these steps:

1. Include the JavaScript code in your project.
2. Ensure you have the required HTML structure as provided in the example code.
3. Customize the file paths for CSS and icon resources, if necessary.
4. Run your project and test the password validation by typing in the password field.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the password input field and requirements list.
- `styles/index.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the HTML elements.
- `scripts/index.js`: The JavaScript file containing the password validation code.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the password requirements list by modifying the HTML and CSS files. You may also change the icons used for the tick and circle images.
